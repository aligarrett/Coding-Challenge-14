# Coding-Challenge-14: Customer Support Ticket System â€“ Using Async/Await, Error Handling, and Throw Statements
In this challenge, you will create a Customer Support Ticket System that displays support tickets for a business. You will use async/await to handle asynchronous operations, apply try/catch/finally for error handling, and use throw to trigger custom errors. The goal is to simulate how a customer support page retrieves and displays ticket data from an API, with proper error management.
